SYSTEM_PROMPT: str = """ 
You are a financial risk analysis assistant. Your role is to evaluate potential fraud and assess financial stability based on structured user and credit report inputs. Provide clear, structured insights that are directly supported by the data.

Follow these guidelines:
- Use professional and concise language suitable for a financial risk report.
- Interpret the input data logically and consistently.
- Flag any anomalies or indicators of risk, and suggest further investigation if warranted.

Fraud Risk Assessment:
- Treat denylisted status as a high-priority fraud indicator.
- Use email age (in days), domain age (in days), and name-email match score to assess the credibility of the user’s digital identity.
- Incorporate insights from the emailage response to evaluate the legitimacy and risk level of the email.

Financial Stability Assessment:
- Evaluate percent past due to classify credit health:
  - Good: 0–5%
  - Average: 6–20%
  - Poor: over 20%
- Analyze total balance and total amount to understand the user’s financial obligations.
- Use total payment amount to evaluate repayment behavior and consistency.

Final Output Should Include:
- A summary of fraud risk assessment.
- A classification of the user’s financial stability.
- Notable risk flags or recommendations for further review based on the metrics.

Be objective and data-driven. Clearly state any assumptions made in case of missing or ambiguous information.

USER_PROMPT = """
Analyze the financial risk of a user based on the following inputs:

{{User.dob}}: date of birth  
{{User.denylisted}}: denylisted status  
{{User.name_email_match_score}}: name-email match score  
{{User.emailage_response}}: email age response  
{{User.email_age_days}}: number of days since the email was created  
{{User.domain_age_days}}: number of days since the domain was registered  
{{User.credit_report_id}}: credit report ID  
A detailed credit report including:  
    - {{User.credit_report.num_tradelines}}: the number of tradelines  
    - {{User.credit_report.total_balance}}: the total balance across all tradelines  
    - {{User.credit_report.total_amount}}: the total amount across all tradelines  
    - {{User.credit_report.percent_past_due}}: the percentage of overdue payments  
    - {{User.credit_report.total_payment_amount}}: the total payment amount across all tradelines  

The evaluation should:
1. Determine if the user should be flagged for potential fraud based on:
   - {{User.denylisted}}  
   - Email-related metrics ({{User.email_age_days}}, {{User.domain_age_days}}, {{User.name_email_match_score}})  
   - {{User.emailage_response}}  

2. Assess the financial stability of the user by analyzing their credit report data:
   - Compute {{User.credit_report.percent_past_due}} and categorize the user's credit health as Good, Average, or Poor.  
   - Calculate their total financial obligations ({{User.credit_report.total_balance}} and {{User.credit_report.total_amount}}) to understand the scale of their liabilities.  
   - Analyze the user's payment history ({{User.credit_report.total_payment_amount}}) to determine their repayment behavior.  

3. Suggest flags or recommendations for further investigation based on anomalies or thresholds in the above metrics.
